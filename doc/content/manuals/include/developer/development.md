## Developing new objects

MASTODON is built upon [MOOSE](https://mooseframework.inl.gov) and
therefore uses the MOOSE architecture and protocols for development. Developers therefore are highly
encouraged to look into the MOOSE Framework and also reach out to the MASTODON team [here](help/contact_us.md) when
planning to develop new objects. Development and inclusion of a new object (material, boundary condition, etc.) in MASTODON (or MOOSE) involves the following steps:


- Writing the code
- Writing the documentation, which includes

  - Syntax information
  - Theory and references in the theory manual
  - Usage instructions in the user manual

- Examples, if any
- Creating test problems that will be included in the list of tests

MOOSE and MASTODON use specific formatting for all the C++ code in the repository. This formatting is explained in the [MOOSE software coding standards](sqa/framework_scs.md).
