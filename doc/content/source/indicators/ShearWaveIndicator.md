# ShearWaveIndicator

!syntax description /Adaptivity/Indicators/ShearWaveIndicator

## Description

An indicator that computes the minimum element size based on the shear-wave speed.

The minimum element length ($\lambda_{min}$), which this indicator computes, is computed based on the cutoff
frequency ($f$) and shear-wave speed ($v_s$) defined below as:

!equation id=eqn:min_length
\lambda_{min} = \frac{v_s}{f}

The shear wave speed is supplied as a material property and the cutoff frequency is defined as a constant value
via the input parameters.
