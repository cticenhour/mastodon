# Test to demonstrate the Seismic Probabilistic Risk Assessment (SPRA)
# infrastructure in MASTODON. This test involves three input files:
#
# 1. master.i - The Master file that bins the hazard curve and scales ground
# motions for each bin for use in probabilistic simulations.
#
# 2. sub.i - The file that obtains the scaled ground motions from master.i and
# transfers these ground motions as inputs to the finite-element model and also
# contains the parameters for probabilistic simulation. This file acts as the
# sub file for master.i and master file for subsub.i.
#
# 3. subsub.i - The file that contains the finite-element model.
